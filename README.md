Python script for interpolating missing data in mercury level measurements using timestamps

# Mercury Level Interpolation

This Python project demonstrates how to interpolate missing data points in a dataset of mercury level measurements, using linear interpolation.

## Features

- Handles missing data points labeled as `Missing_X`.
- Uses timestamps to compute linear interpolations between known data points.
- Dynamically handles any number of missing values.

## Example Input and Output

### Input
A tab-separated text file or list of readings:
